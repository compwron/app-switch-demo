````cd glove ; pod install ; open glove.xcworkspace````

````cd ../helmet ; pod install ; open helmet.xcworkspace````

In xCode, open and run Helmet and Glove so that the apps are installed in the same simulator. Then click on the link in glove to take you to helmet. Helmet should open. Click the return button to complete the round trip back to Glove. Once back in Glove, you should see a pop-up with a note from Helmet.

This is an iOS demo of apps opening other apps, for my own learning.
