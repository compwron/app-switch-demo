cd glove ; pod install ; cd ../helmet ; pod install

Open and run Helmet and Glove so that the apps are installed in the same simulator. Then click on the links. The other app should open. Click the return button to complete the round trip.

This is a demo of apps opening other apps, for my own learning.
